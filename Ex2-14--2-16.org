* Interval Arithmetic
** Problems
   - There are a lot of issues that arise when trying to do math with intervals.
   - The biggest immediate problem that I see is that we lose algebraic identity, which leads to the break down of a lot of algebraic rules.
     - For example, there are a lot of numbers that fit into one interval (if the variance is 1% and the center is 100, it could be anything from 99% to 101%).
     - That means we get to the point where a(b+c) != ab + ac. Standard algebra falls apart.

** Interval Arithmetic System
   - I don't know how you can create a system that keeps the usefulness (including the vagueness) of intervals while still ensuring that basic arithmetic systems still work.
   - It seems that, to get the benefit of arithmetic, you need to be able to ensure that "A = A".
